Lisa, Tom, and Sam, known as the Math Buddies, were well-regarded for their math skills and were favorites of their teacher, Mrs. Kim. Living in the same neighborhood, they cheerfully welcomed a new friend, Max. Max, excited to join their group, asked about Lisa's house location. Lisa, testing Max's math skills, challenged him to find the midpoint of the line connecting Tom's and Sam's houses. Intrigued yet puzzled, Max sought your help. Can you assist Max in solving this straightforward math puzzle?
